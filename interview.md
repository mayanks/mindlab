<p>Are you trying to crack an interview to get your dream job? If you learn mind hacks to easily nail it what would that do for you? 
</p>

<p>In my years of experience as a coach/ trainer I often meet people who are competent in their line of work but don’t end up getting a job due to unknown reasons. That results in disappointment sometimes leading to the conclusion that they are not skilled enough, which  is usually not the case.</p>

<p>Getting a job requires you to basically play on the interviewer’s psychology. If there are 5 people who are equally qualified how will the interviewers decide whom to pick?  It is eventually a mind game. One whose outcome can be controlled if you are trained to do so. </p>

<p>There are unconscious filters that run in the background causing people to perceive you in a certain way. If you could learn the art of finding out what people want and give it to them, they will give you what you want. They will also think it’s their idea. </p>

<p>If you are looking to crack a job interview this is definitely the most important training you can take.</p>
